## Self-Host

Generally, there is only one hosted Scholar-Watch needed for each group, as they can customize their own registered authors in their fields. So here is the way for self-host.

```bash
# (recommended)create a conda env, you should install conda/miniconda first
conda create -n streamlit python=3.7
conda activate streamlit

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# config the config.ini
# make sure your host could visit Google Scholar. maybe https_proxy needed.
##   (1) if host server could, then set mode = server
##   (2) if host server could not, then set https_proxy and set mode = local

# run Scholar-Watcher app
streamlit run 1_üè†_Scholar_Watcher.py # which is the home page
```
