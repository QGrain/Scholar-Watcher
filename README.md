# Scholar-Watcher
A web app for watching the authors' google scholar, which is based on scholarly and streamlit.


## Features

- Fetch the **citations and changes** of the registered authors. (Support default daily update and force update)
- Display details and Chart Analysis of **Focus Authors**.
- Support add/modify **the registered authors**. (Now disabled for the security concern)
- Display the **recent publications** of **Focus Authors**. (Incoming)


## Demo

## Self-Host

Generally, there is only one hosted Scholar-Watch needed for each group, as they can customize their own registered authors in their fields. So here is the way for self-host.

```bash
# (recommended)create a conda env, you should install conda/miniconda first
conda create -n streamlit python=3.7
conda activate streamlit

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run Scholar-Watcher app
streamlit run 1_üè†_Scholar_Watcher.py # which is the home page
```
